# Solong - 1337 (42 Network)
Solong is a project focused on creating a basic 2D game using the MiniLibX library. The goal is to implement a simple game where the player navigates through a grid, collecting items and avoiding obstacles.

## Introduction
The Solong project is designed to help students learn about game development fundamentals, including rendering graphics, handling user input, and managing game states. Using the MiniLibX library, students will create a game that involves moving a player character around a grid and interacting with various game elements.

## Key Concepts
1. Game Rendering
Learn how to render graphics on the screen using the MiniLibX library. Implement functions to draw game elements such as walls, collectibles, and the player character.

### 2. User Input Handling
Handle user input to control the player character. Implement key press and release events to move the player around the grid and interact with the game world.

### 3. Game Logic
Develop the core game logic, including collision detection, item collection, and game state management. Ensure that the game behaves as expected and responds correctly to player actions.

### 4. File Handling
Use file handling to load and parse game maps from external files. Implement functions to read and interpret map data, and translate it into game elements on the screen.

### Features
2D Game Rendering: Create and display a 2D game world using MiniLibX.
Player Control: Move the player character around the grid using keyboard input.
Game Elements: Render and interact with various game elements, such as walls and collectibles.
File-Based Maps: Load game maps from external files to create dynamic and varied game levels.
